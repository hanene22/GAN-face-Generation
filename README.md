# GAN-face-Generation
A  GAN model for generating human face images using Python

This project aims to create a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model for generating celebrity faces using the CelebA dataset. GANs are specialized neural networks that can generate realistic data by learning from an existing dataset.

# Project Description
In this project, we utilize TensorFlow and Python to build a GAN model capable of generating realistic celebrity face images. The model consists of a generator and a discriminator that train adversarially to produce compelling images.

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle via this link: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset

# Repository Contents
The repository for this project contains the following components:

gan_model.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for the GAN model, training, and image generation.

gan_model.h5: The exported GAN model in h5 format.

image-generate.py: A Python script that imports the GAN model and generates a face image from the model.

README.md: This file explaining the project, its purpose, and its contents.

Clone this repository to your computer:

git clone https://github.com/YourName/CelebA-GAN-Project.git
Open the gan_model.ipynb Jupyter notebook to view the GAN model code and the training process.

Run the Jupyter notebook to train the GAN model and generate celebrity face images.

Use the generate_image.py script to generate celebrity face images from the exported GAN model.
